# Code Refactor Starter Code
Using a starter code given, the HTML and CSS were cleaned up to make the site more functional, semantic and accessible.

## HTML
- A div id was added to create a functional button for the header component "Search Engine Optimization"
- div id's were replaced with section id to create a better structure to the HTML and make the code more semantic
- alt id was added to create accessible image code

## CSS
- classes that shared attributes were consolidated, leaving the functionality while reducing clutter
